The project elaborates on the notions of accommodation, pretence, linguistic etiolation, and expressive communication within an Austin-inspired model of speech act dynamics, and uses the resulting framework to account for insinuation and other forms of non-overt speech. 

I carried out this project at the University of Cambridge, both at the Faculty of Philosophy, where I served as an Academic Visitor, and at Clare Hall College, where I was a Visiting Fellow, during the period from 1 October 2023 to 31 July 2024.

The results of this project were presented in the form of seminar and workshop presentations, a research paper, work-in-progress drafts, and a book proposal entitled <i>Unspoken Meanings: An Essay on Insinuation and Other Forms of Non-Overt Speech</i>.
