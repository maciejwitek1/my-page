title: " Czynności illokucyjne jako akty interakcyjne (Illocutionary Acts as Interactional Actions). <i>Przegląd Filozoficzny. Nowa Seria</i>, <i>19</i>(3), 2010, 359-390."
abstract: "In this paper, I challenge the traditional assumption that illocutionary acts of the same type are homogeneous with respect to the factors that determine their illocutionary force. I identify a fundamental dispute between Austinian and Gricean traditions: Austinians treat basic illocutionary acts as essentially conventional, while Griceans view them as fundamentally communicative, driven by speaker intentions. I propose an alternative framework grounded in the idea of <i>heterogeneity</i>: illocutionary force varies across instances of the same type because it depends on different kinds of interactional effects. Central to this approach is the concept of <i>interactional effect</i>—the specific change in the listener’s behavior, thoughts, or actions that an utterance brings about within a social interaction. I argue that this interactional effect, whether rooted in conventional patterns or in the speaker’s intentions, better explains the illocutionary force of speech acts. I situate this framework within broader debates on speech-act theory and outlines its methodological implications."
