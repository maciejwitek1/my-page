title: "Contextual Facilitation of Colour Recognition: Penetrating Beliefs or Colour-Shape Associations? <i>Ruch Filozoficzny</i>, <i>75</i>(2), 2019, 199-208."
abstract: "The article presents a defense of the thesis that early vision processes are informationally isolated. Early vision is understood as a perceptual process whose inputs consist of sensory information and whose outputs are so-called primal sketches or shallow visual representations—informational states that represent visual objects with respect to their shape, location, size, color, and brightness. Some researchers challenge the thesis of the informational isolation of early vision by appealing to data suggesting that color recognition processes are supported by beliefs concerning the typical colors of objects of a given kind. The article advances arguments for the claim that these data can be explained by invoking the notion of associations between representations of shapes and colors."
