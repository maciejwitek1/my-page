abstract: "The chapter develops a model of linguistic interaction conceived as an illocutionary game, extending Austin’s distinction between locutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary aspects of speech from individual speech acts to structured forms of goal-directed social activity. An illocutionary game is understood as an interaction between at least two participants whose verbal and non-verbal moves are evaluated against a dynamically evolving score. Each move is formally represented as a function mapping one score state to another, where score states encode those contextual features that are relevant for interpreting and assessing subsequent moves. Central to the model is the idea that illocutionary moves generate normative facts, such as rights, commitments, and obligations, which constitute the core of what it means to “score points” in such a game. The chapter concludes with a methodological remark on the explanatory role of score-based models in the study of linguistic activity and illustrates the framework with two case studies: rule-establishing discourse and argumentative dialogue."
