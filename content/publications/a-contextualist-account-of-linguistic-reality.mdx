title: "A Contextualist Account of the Linguistic Reality. In: J. Odrowąż-Sypniewska (Ed.), <i>Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science at Warsaw University</i>, vol. 4, Warszawa: Semper 2008, 59-80."
abstract: "This paper presents a contextualist account of linguistic reality, arguing against the strictly psychological interpretations of linguistic properties as proposed by Devitt. It posits that linguistic entities are better understood as complex physical states of affairs termed complete linguistic signs, integrating both linguistic tokens and context. A Millikanian perspective is advocated to explain human communication, reflecting on the Underdeterminacy Thesis as a key structural feature of linguistic interactions, emphasizing contextual factors rather than cognitive processes."
