abstract: "The paper examines the equivalence property (EP) regarding the use of the truth predicate in conversational contexts, exploring its theoretical implications through three accounts: Ramsey's redundancy theory, Horwich's minimal conception, and inflationism. It presents a critique of semantic deflationism, arguing that it fails to adequately explain the cognitive processes at play in truth attribution and the relevance of EP in evaluating statements. The work concludes that EP, as a pragmatic phenomenon, requires a more nuanced understanding that integrates both meaning and the context of use."
