title: "O pożytkach płynących z dzielenia włosa na czworo (On the Benefits of Splitting Hairs). <i>Uniwersytet Zielonogórski. Miesięcznik Społeczności Akademickiej</i>, <i>3</i>, 2005, 6-9."
abstract: " The article offers a defense of philosophical reflection against the charge of excessive pedantry, arguing that “splitting hairs” plays a crucial role in the intellectual vitality of Western culture. Philosophy is characterized as a form of inquiry distinguished by exceptional sensitivity to conceptual problems that arise outside philosophy, in domains such as science and political thought. By identifying and addressing these problems, philosophy develops new concepts that subsequently reshape non-philosophical practices. This thesis is illustrated through two historical case studies: the problem of change in early Greek philosophy and the problem of freedom in modern political theory. Together they show how philosophical problem-finding and conceptual innovation foster cultural dynamism and practical transformation."
