title: "Niedookreślenie językowe z punktu widzenia teorii zwrotnych warunków prawdziwości"
abstract: "The aim of the paper is to present the theory of reflexive truth conditions with particular reference to the literalist account of communicative competence it offers. Like contextualist conceptions, the theory allows for the phenomenon of linguistic underdeterminacy. Unlike most popular accounts of communicative competence, however, it takes the phenomenon to be a property of the semantic, not pragmatic, dimension of linguistic competence."
