title: "Intention and responsibility in demonstrative reference. A view from the theory of speech acts. <i>Studia Semiotyczne</i>, <i>36</i>(2), 2022, 63-84."
abstract: "In <i>Critical Pragmatics</i>, Korta and Perry argue that the object a speaker refers to with a demonstrative expression combined with a pointing gesture is determined by her directing intention rather than by her demonstration. They acknowledge that our use of the ordinary concept of ‘what is said’ is affected by our judgements about the speaker’s responsibility for the results of her careless pointing; however, they claim that the effects are perlocutionary and have no bearing on determining the referential content of the speaker’s act. In this paper, I argue that the consequences of careless pointing are illocutionary and play a role in determining demonstrative reference. I also distinguish between two types of referential content which are attributable to the speaker’s utterance and shape its discursive behaviour: what is intended, which is determined by the speaker’s directing intention, and what is public, which depends on what she can legitimately be held responsible for."
