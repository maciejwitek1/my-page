title: " Varieties of Linguistic Conventions. A book symposium on Ernie Lepore and Matthew Stone’s <i>Imagination and Convention. Distinguishing Grammar and Inference in Language</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2015). <i>Polish Journal of Philosophy</i>, <i>10</i>(1), 2016, 7-12."
abstract: "This editorial introduces a thematic issue devoted to Ernie Lepore and Matthew Stone’s Imagination and Convention, which advances a non-Gricean, convention-based account of linguistic communication. It outlines the contrast between Gricean inferential models and Lepore and Stone’s direct intentionalism, emphasizing extended grammar and disambiguation over pragmatic enrichment. The editorial surveys contributions by Manuel García-Carpintero, Kasia Jaszczolt, Joanna Odrowąż-Sypniewska, Marcin Matczak, and Maciej Witek, who critically examine indirect speech acts, conversational implicatures, varieties of convention, legal interpretation, and accommodation. Together, these papers assess the scope, limits, and theoretical consequences of convention-centered approaches to meaning and linguistic practice."
