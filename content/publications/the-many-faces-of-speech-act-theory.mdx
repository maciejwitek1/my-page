title: " The many faces of speech act theory — editorial to special issue on speech actions. <i>Lodz Papers in Pragmatics</i>, <i>5</i>(1), 2009, 1-8."
abstract: "This editorial introduces the <i>Lodz Papers in Pragmatics</i> special issue <i>The Many Faces of Speech Act Theory</i>, which showcases the diversity of contemporary approaches to speech acts understood as forms of linguistic action embedded in complex communicative contexts. The editors situate the volume against the background of the Austin–Searle tradition while emphasizing the fragmentation of speech act theory into partially incompatible frameworks that nevertheless share a commitment to language as action. The contributions reflect this diversity. Robert M. Harnish examines internalist and externalist classifications of speech act theories; Marina Sbisà defends an Austinian, convention-based account of illocutionary force; Friedrich C. Doerge argues for preserving Austin’s original conception of illocutionary acts; Maciej Witek defends reflexive intention-based accounts of communication; Iwona Witczak-Plisiecka argues for the autonomy of pragmatics; Rita Brdar-Szabó and Mario Brdar analyze indirect directives in recipes cross-linguistically; and Mary Kate McGowan applies speech act theory to debates on pornography and free speech. Together, the papers highlight open questions concerning force, context, convention, and the architecture of linguistic action."
