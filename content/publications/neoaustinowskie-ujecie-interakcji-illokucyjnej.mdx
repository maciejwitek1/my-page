title: "Neoaustionowskie ujęcie interakcji illokucyjnej (A Neo-Austinian Account of Illocutionary Interaction). In: P. Stalmaszczyk, P. Cap (red.), <i>Pragmatyka, retoryka, argumentacja. Obrazy języka i dyskursu w naukach humaniatycznych</i>, Kraków: Universitas 2014, 139-159."
abstract: "In this chapter, I present a neo-Austinian account of speech acts and defend the claim that the category of illocutionary force is useful in research on linguistic interaction. The chapter is divided into three parts. In the first, I review critical opinions concerning research approaches inspired by the concept of illocutionary force. I also formulate two theses about speech act theory—a strong one and a weak one—and argue that the opinions discussed concern, at most, the former. The strong thesis holds that the theory of illocutionary acts provides the foundations for all research on linguistic interaction; by contrast, according to the weak thesis, the category of illocutionary force enables an accurate account of conversational mechanisms responsible for the creation of normative states of affairs. In the second part, I present the core ideas of an approach to speech acts that I call <i>interactionist</i> and explain why it deserves to be described as neo-Austinian. In the third part, I offer, among other things, an outline of a neo-Austinian explanation of the mechanisms responsible for modifying the normative sphere of the entitlements and commitments of interaction participants, thereby contributing to the justification of the weak thesis about speech act theory."
