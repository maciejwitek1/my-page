import CvButton from '@components/CvButton.astro';

I am a Professor of Philosophy in the the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.usz.edu.pl/fik/"><b>Institute of Philosophy and Cognitive Science </b></a> at the University of Szczecin (Poland), a Life Member of Clare Hall College (Cambridge), and the coordinator of the <a target="_blank" href="http://ccrg.usz.edu.pl"><b>Cognition & Communication Research Group (CCRG)</b></a>.
\
My research focuses on pragmatics and the philosophy of language. I develop an Austin-inspired theory of speech acts and use it to explore phenomena such as irony, insinuation, conceptual change, accommodation, linguistic underdeterminacy, language conventions and speech act norms.\
\
I am currently preparing a monograph *Unspoken Meanings: An Essay on Insinuation and Other Forms of Non-Overt Speech* and leading a project *Lexicalized Concepts from the Perspectives of Meaning Eliminativism and Dynamic Conventionalism: An Austinian Account of Conceptual Change and Amelioration*, funded by the National Science Centre, Poland (2024/53/B/HS1/00590).\
